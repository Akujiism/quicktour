Slide 1

Welcome to Haiku's Quick Tour

Especially new users are sometimes confused by the differences in Haiku's user interface and approach to every day tasks compared to their other OS. In just a few slides, you'll learn about the most important Haiku features and peculiarities that'll help you get a running start.

Start the tour



Slide 2

The Deskbar

By default at the top right corner of the desktop, the Deskbar is the hub of interacting with Haiku. You can start applications, applet and preferences from there, for example, and switch between running applications.

Slide 3

The window widgets

[screenshot of window, annotated: Close button, Zoom button (usually maximizes the window), Double-click the tab to hide/minimize a window (find it again in the Deskbar), Move a window by grabbing it at the tab or border, Resize from the corner or by dragging a border with the right mouse button.]

Slide 4

Shortcut key

The Keymap preferences let you switch the standard ALT key to CTRL (Windows/Linux mode). This is a global switch, so for example quitting a program in the shell will then be done with ALT+C instead the usual CTRL+C.
This inconsistancy is one reason for the default ALT shortcut in Haiku.

Slide 5

Twitcher

Holding CTRL+Tab summons the Twitcher where you switch between running applications. Tapping the Tab key only quickly while holding CTRL switches to the last used application.

Slide 6

Team monitor

If some application crashed badly and maybe won't disappear from the Deskbar's running application list, press CTRL+ALT+DEL to invoke the Team monitor. Here you can select an entry and kill a misbehaving app.

Slide 7

Window management: Move & Resize

Haiku offers a neat way to quickly move or resize windows:
Holding down CTRL ALT will highlight the window borders nearest to the mouse pointer. Click and dragging with the right mouse button will resize the window along the highlighted border(s). Click and drag with the left mouse button to move it around.

Slide 8

Window management: Stack & Tile

"Stacking" is putting windows on top of each other, automatically moving the yellow tabs into position. While holding the OPT key (normally that's the WIN key), tabs change color when they overlap; drop the window to establish the stacking.

"Tiling" means gluing windows horizontally or vertically together. While holding OPT, the borders that'll fuse together when you drop the window change color when brought near each other.

Slide 9

Workspaces

Workspaces are virtual desktops, complete with their own resolution, color depth and background. Up to 32 of these workspaces can be set from the Screen preferences.
The Workspaces desktop applet can be used to change workspaces or to drag a window from one to another.
The quick keyboard shortcut to change workspaces is CTRL+ALT+Cursor.

Slide 10

Single window navigation

Double-clicking your way down folder after folder, you'll quickly end up with many open Tracker windows. Holding the OPT key (normally the WIN key) prevents this as it automatically closes the parent folder.
Alternatively, you can activate Single window navigation from the Tracker preferences. Show navigator will add back/forward buttons.

Slide 11

Drill-down navigation

A nice alternative to opening a deep hierarchy of folders is called "drill-down navigation". Right-clicking a folder or anywhere in a Tracker window (or the Desktop) will open a context menu. Beside various expected commands, there's a menu of the current folder at the top that contains all its subfolders.
Drill your way down until you find the folder or file to open.

Slide 12

Mounting volumes

In order to access a harddisk, CD, USB stick etc., you first have to mount the volume, that is, let the system know it's there.
This is done with a right-click on the Desktop or an already mounted volume (like the boot disk) and choosing the volume from the Mount submenu. You find the same Mount menu in the Deskbar.
Before removing e.g. a USB stick, you have to right-click its icon and choose Unmount and wait for its icon to disappear. Otherwise you may lose data not yet written to it!

Slide 13

Queries

Files on Haiku formatted (BFS) volumes are quickly searched with Find... from the Deskbar. Instead of file and folder names, you also look through filetype specific attributes, e.g. for an artist in your MP3 collection.

Slide 14

Wireless connection

You can connect to your WLAN router either by right-clicking the NetworkStatus icon in Deskbar's tray, or by selecting your network from the Network preferences. When connection is established, you'll be asked for the network's encryption and password.

Slide 15

Getting more and updating software

HaikuDepot from the Deskbar's applications menu is where to search, install, update and uninstall software packages. SoftwareUpdater should be started from time to time to updated already installed software as well as Haiku itself.
